## üéØ **Current Configuration:**

```typescript
export const OFFERING_ID = 'pro'; // Your RevenueCat Offering ID
```

## ‚úèÔ∏è **To Change the Offering ID:**

What would you like to change it to? Just let me know the new offering ID and I'll update it for you. 

Common offering IDs are:
- `'default'` - RevenueCat's default offering
- `'premium'` - Common for premium subscriptions
- `'main'` - Simple main offering
- `'subscription'` - Generic subscription offering

**Important Notes:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **The offering ID must match exactly** what you have configured in your RevenueCat dashboard
- This ID is used by both `SubscriptionInfoScreen` and `PaywallScreen` to load the correct subscription packages
- If you change it, make sure it exists in your RevenueCat dashboard first

**What's your new offering ID?** I'll update the configuration for you.
